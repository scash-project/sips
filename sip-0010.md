## Abstract

Replace legacy Bitcoin difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) with Bitcoin Cash DAA 'aserti3-2d' (or 'ASERT' for short) [1] activating at block 21,000.

## Motivation

Block production with an ideal target time of 10 minutes is impacted by hash power fluctuation. The ASERT DAA will adjust the network difficulty every block, helping to restore block production to the desired target rate more quickly than the legacy DAA which only adjusts network difficulty every 2016 blocks. More rationale is provided by the ASERT DAA authors [2].

## Specification

### ASERT

The current Bicoin Cash ASERT DAA implementation is used with minor modifications:
- uint512 to handle overflow
- additional test vectors

### Anchor Block

The anchor block selected is block 18144, the start of the 9th difficulty period under the legacy DAA. During this period, network hashrate has fallen resulting in slower block production than expected.

The genesis block was not selected as the anchor block because:
- the legacy DAA only considers the previous 2016 blocks and does not correct for historical drift since genesis
- correcting for historical drift with ASERT DAA would increase difficulty upon activation, given that blocks have been faster than expected since genesis.

## Deployment

The ASERT DAA will be activated at block 21000.

## Implementation
